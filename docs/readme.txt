1 About

2CC Trams provides many different tram vehicles from around the world. 
The set is not aimed at specific tram operators or manufacturers,
but rather gives you a broad selection so that you can be your own 
company. To support that goal, the vehicles are in dual company colours.



----------------------
2 Usage and Parameters
----------------------

The first tram vehicle is available from 1872. Build tram tracks and 
tram depots to use the tram vehicles (click and hold the Road button to 
access the Tramway construction toolbar).

By default you can only carry passengers in the tram vehicles. Set the 
parameter option if you want to be able to carry other cargo types as 
well.

By default each vehicle can be purchased for 10 years after 
introduction. The vehicle life (time when a vehicle is old after 
purchase) is generally much larger. If you want to be able to purchase 
vehicles of each type for a longer period than 10 years, then enable 
the "Long model life" parameter option. This increases the model life 
to the real life usage in active service. Note that this will result in 
a very long purchase list. The 10 year availability does not apply to 
vehicles introduced from 2010 onwards.

3 Requests
----------

If you like a particular tram to be added to the set, you can make a 
request for that. Post your request in the development topic at 
TT-Forums.net (https://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?f=26&t=71217) 
and preferrably also to the issue tracker at the #openttdcoop DevZone 
(http://dev.openttdcoop.org/projects/trams-2cc/issues) such that the 
request is not lost.

To avoid disappointment, consider the following rules for requests:
- The manufacturer and model must not already be present in the set;
- If the manufacturer is present in the set, the model must fill a 
  regional or timeframe gap;
- Sufficient information must be available to draw and code the vehicle;
- If the manufacturer and model is used in multiple cities, first the 
  most underrepresented country is chosen, then the most 
  underrepresented city;
- The development team reserves the right to interpret these rules more 
  like guidelines.
